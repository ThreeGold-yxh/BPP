BPP: A platform for explainable biochemical pathway prediction
> Authors: Xinhao Yi, Siwei Liu, Douglas McCloskey, Shiyang Liang, Frank Wu, Zaiqaio Meng

## Contributions
1. Develop biochemical pathway predictor (BPP), an interactive biochemical pathway link prediction platform.

2. Enables participant link prediction, product link prediction and node structure prediction for biochemical pathway.

3. Equip with a pathway prediction explainer to interpret the results and calculate the contributions of participating elements.


## Motivation

1. Identifying potential links in biochemical pathway networks is essential for targeting disease markers, discovering drug targets, reconfiguring metabolic networks and addressing gaps in pathways holes in biosynthesis.

2. Traditional experimental methods can impose significant time and labour burdens on researchers, due to a vast number of candidates, consequently, our goal is to enhance the efficiency of pathway studies.
